To all Antivirus vendor and MRHPx Virtual Desktop User
+====================================================+
Below the reason why some Antivirus programs Screams like a GIRLS when you're
activated 'Run at Startup up Windows' feature in MRHPx Virtual Desktop ;)
Yes, I've adopted 'File Self-Copying' just like Worm infection. It's copying
itself to system root directory. As long as I know this method won't harm you
nor the operating system. 'Cause the program will be deleting itself when you
deactivated 'Run at Startup up Windows' feature in MRHPx Virtual Desktop
It just only a concept.. So don't be surprise..
and don't judge MRHPx Virtual Desktop as a virus! I don't want to harm you
even for a little! Know it!

Below I've attached the code for you to know..
Whether you understand assembly or NOT it's not my problem :P
(X = Value/Contents)

invoke RegSetValueEx,XXX,XXX,X,REG_SZ,XXX,X
invoke GetSystemDirectory,XXX,sizeof XXX
invoke SetCurrentDirectory,XXX
invoke GetModuleFileName,X,XXX,SIZEOF XXX
invoke lstrcat,XXX,XXX
invoke lstrcmpi,XXX,XXX
.IF  eax!=X 
   invoke CopyFile,XXX,XXX,XXX
   invoke RegOpenKeyEx,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,XXX,X, \
   KEY_SET_VALUE,XXX
   invoke lstrlen,XXX
   invoke RegSetValueEx,XXX,XXX,X, \
   REG_SZ,XXX,XXX
   invoke RegCloseKey,XXX   
.ENDIF

NB : Antivirus vendor, please only made a quality scanner.. don't made a silly scanner.
     If you can't, why don't you just selling pizza?? It would be better :P
